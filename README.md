# Denoising-Of-Image-Using-GAN
Image denoising using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is a technique for removing noise from digital images by training a neural network to generate clean images from noisy ones GANs are deep learning models
that consist of two neural networks, a generator, and a discriminator, that work together to learn the underlying distribution of a given dataset. By using a GAN-based approach, image denoising can be formulated as an unsupervised learning problem, where the generator is trained to produce a clean image from a noisy input, while the discriminator is trained to differentiate between real clean images and generated clean images. The GAN-based approach to image denoising has several advantages over traditional methods, such as the ability to produce realistic and visually pleasing images, and the potential for generalization to unseen noise
patterns. However, training GANs can be challenging due to the instability of the training process and the need for large amounts of data. Recent advancements in GAN architectures and training techniques have addressed some of these challenges and have led to improved image denoising performance. Overall, GAN-based image denoising is a promising research direction that has the potential to improve the quality of noisy images in a variety of applications, including medical imaging, surveillance, and photography.
